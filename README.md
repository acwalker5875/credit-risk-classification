Module 20 Homework



The purpose of this analysis is to rate the risks of loans given by the bank, and training the model to be able to predict healthy vs high-risk loans. 

Details of Learning Model:
- The model has a weighted accuracy of 99% for both precision and recall.
- The precision is extremely high; 94% for high-risk loans, and 99% for healthy loans
- The recall score is good; but only 84% for high-risk loans, and 100% for healthy loans


The model used a dataset containing the history of lending activity to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using the provided data, the model was able to predict both healthy and high-risk loans with a high degree of accuracy. I would recommend this model be adopted and used by the company to assist in future loan decisions. The use of this model would assist in limiting the risk taken on by the company, and would also expedite the loan decision process. By having a lower percentage of loans at risk of default, while also being able to provide and service more loans ina shorter time, the company is in a position to grow its profits while limiting its own risk and exposure.
